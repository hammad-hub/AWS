Requirement : 
Objective: Deploy Web Application on the Amazon EC2 Windows instances with Elastic Load Balancer in front of web application servers & database.
Use two Availability Zones for provision of two web application servers in separate private subnets and configure them for high availability.

Availabiity Zone: US East (Northern Virginia)

  Zone 1 - us-east-1A
  Zone 2 - us-east-1b
  
Subnet = Create 5 Subnets 

2 in public 
  1 = Bastion host 
  2 = NatGateway

3 in Private subnet 
  Subnet 1   = one IIS VM via AutoScaling in | Zone 1 - us-east-1A
  Subnet 2   = one IIS VM via AutoScaling in  | Zone 2 - us-east-1b
  Subnet 3   = one MSSQL RDS Database in Subnet 3 via AutoScaling in  | Zone 2 - us-east-1b
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  
Step 1  #   Create VPC : 
    1.1 - Create VPC  ( Make sure to copy the name of VPC - This will help you to search for deployments associated with vpc)
    
    Name or Tag : [Your Name or identifier ]-[VPC]-[Region]  | For Example : Cloudhs-vpc-US East (Northern Virginia) Region
    
Step 2   # Create Subnet as Requested :

  2.2 Create subnet  ( for this excersise we will create 5 subnet )
  
    Name or Tage :  [Subnet]-(public) or (priate) - (Zone) - (Identifier or Name)
    
    Zone1 - US-E-1A
snet01-pub-us-east-1a-10.0.1.0-awscloudhs  - Zone 1A - Public 
snet02-pub-us-east-1b-10.0.2.0-awscloudhs	- Zone 1B - Public

Zone 2 - us-east-1b
snet03-pvt-us-east-1a-10.0.3.0-awscloudhs	- Zone 1A - Private
snet04-pvt-us-east-1b-10.0.4.0-awscloudhs	- Zone 1B - Private
snet05-pvt-us-east-1b-10.0.5.0-awscloudhs	 - Zone 1B - Private

Step 3 - # Create Internet Gateway 
Tag or Name :  [IGW]- [Identifier] 

Step 4 - # Create NatGateway 
Tage or Name - NAT- [Identifie]

Step 5  # Route Table   

  5.1 Find default RT by using VPC id 
  5.2 Rename to Private or leave as is 
  5.3 Create a new Route table for public traffice 
  5.4 Associate subnet 
  5.4.4  Add or associate public route table to public subnet 
  5.4.5  Associate 0.0.0.0 traffice with internet gate way in PUBLIC Route
  5.4.6  Add or associate Private route table to Private subnet 
  5.4.6   Associate 0.0.0.0 traffice with Natgateway way in PRIVATE Route
  
Step 6 -#  Create Load Balancer
